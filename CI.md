# Continuous Integration # 
Is the practice of merging or integrating all developer working copies to a shared mainline(trunk /master), ideally, several times a day.

Repository may become so different from the developers' baselines that they enter what is sometimes referred to as "merge hell", or "integration hell", where the time it takes to integrate exceeds the time it took to make their original changes.

# Continuous Delivery # 
Continuous Delivery means that artifacts are built and made ready to be deployed. But they will not be deployed without a manual decision by a human being. Change must pass through approvation 

# Continuous Deployment #
Continuous Deployment implies all processes are automated, and a single commit triggers an automated pipeline that will eventually bring a new version of your application to the production environment without any human intervention.
 
 This approach works well in enterprise environments where you plan to use the user as the actual tester and it can be quicker to release.

# What is Continuous Testing #
Continuous testing is the process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to obtain feedback on the business risks associated with a software release candidate as rapidly as possible.
 
# PipeLine #
Build pipne line represents the steps to move new code from development into production. The basic steps in the build pipeline are:

1. Develop code
2. Unit test (test the code locally to ensure it works as expected)
3. Integrate (the new code into the existing code base)
4. Acceptance test (test the entire system to ensure it meets the users expectations)
5. Deploy to production

# FUNCTIONAL TESTING #
Is a type of software testing whereby the system is tested against the business requirements/specifications.


# Regression Testing #
Regression testing (rarely non-regression testing[1]) is re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change.[2] If not, that would be called a regression.

# Acceptance Testing:
Tests user requirements on production envrioment or similar.

# Behavior Driven Development #
Behavior Driven Development Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a collaborative process that **creates a shared understanding of requirements between the business and the Development Team**. Its goal is to help guide development, decrease rework, and increase flow. Without focusing on internal implementation, BDD tests are business-facing scenarios that attempt to describe the behavior of a Story, Feature, or Capability from a userâ€™s perspective. When automated, these tests ensure that the system continuously meets the specified behavior even as the system evolves.
