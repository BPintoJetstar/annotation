# What is Camel?
At the core of the Camel framework is a routing engine, or more precisely a routingengine builder. It allows you to define your own routing rules, decide from which
sources to accept messages, and determine how to process and send those messages to
other destinations. Camel uses an integration language that allows you to define complex routing rules, akin to business processes.
