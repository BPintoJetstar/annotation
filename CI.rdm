#Continuous Delivery#

Continuous Delivery means that artifacts are built and made ready to be deployed. But they will not be deployed without a manual decision by a human being.

#Continuous Deployment#
Continuous Deployment implies all processes are automated, and a single commit triggers an automated pipeline that will eventually bring a new version of your application to the production environment without any human intervention.

While many companies practice Continuous Delivery, few embrace Continuous Deployment. Continuous Deployment is risky because anyone could introduce a bug into production with a simple commit, and you need to introduce processes to reduce this risk.
